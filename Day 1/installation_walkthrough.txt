BASIC INSTALLATION
- https://www.anaconda.com/download/success -- Download for your operating system.
	- skip registration. It is not needed.
- follow the setup process. Keep all choices as default.
- once installed, search for 'anaconda prompt' on your computer.

MAKING A VENV FOR PRACTICUM MODULES
- make a folder in a directory of your choice and name it INSPIRE. (easy choice is to make a directory on your desktop.)
- navigate to that folder.
- make a venv (below) and notice where the environment will be stored: "environment location: C:\Users\wular\anaconda3\envs\inspiremd"

CREATE THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

python3 -m venv /path/to/venv/
conda create --name inspiremd # create the conda env (select 'y' whenever prompted, to continue the process)
conda activate inspiremd      # activate the conda env (note that once activated the beginnig of your terminal prompt will have the env name)

DOWNLOADING MODULES IN THE VENV
# for each of these lines (one at a time!), paste them exactly into your anaconda prompt and wait until each 
# select 'y' whenever prompted to continue the installations. this will take a few minutes for each.
conda install -c conda-forge openmm
conda install -c conda-f	orge mdanalysis
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel

or with pip:
	pip install openmm
	pip install --upgrade MDAnalysis
	pip install ipykernel
	
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=inspiremd # install this venv kernel so we may use it in the jupyter notebooks

# open up a local instance of jupyter
- we will use jupyter notebook since that is a good balance between having a presentation along with the code
- open the anaconda navigator.
- select to launch a jupyter notebook. the notebook will appear in a web browser.
- navigate to your inspire folder and the sub-directory containing Eugene's lecture
- open the jupyter notebook that contains the lecture
- make sure that you've selected the inspiremd kernel for use in the notebook (kernal tab --> change kernel --> select inspiremd)

# download chimerax for visualization
- navigate to, and download, ChimeraX (https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/download.html) for molecular visualization.
